# Washington Electric Vehicle Dashboard

## Overview
This repository features a comprehensive Tableau dashboard focusing on electric vehicle (EV) data sourced from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The dashboard provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of EVs, with a particular emphasis on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

## Project Context
The project originated from the need to visualize and understand the landscape of electric vehicles in Washington. Utilizing data from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data), the goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides users with a detailed overview of EVs, their makes, distribution across counties, ownership by postal codes, and insights into the manufacturing companies.

## Key Features
**1. Donut Chart:**

* Displays the division of vehicle types (BEVs and PHEVs) for each manufacturing company.

**2. Column Chart - Make and Model:**

* Allows users to explore different vehicle makes and drill down into specific models by clicking the '+' sign.

**3. Column Chart - Top 10 Counties:**

* Illustrates the top 10 counties where each vehicle make is sold, providing a geographical distribution overview.

**4. Map Chart:**

* Pinpoints vehicle ownership based on postal codes, offering a spatial perspective.

**5. Stacked Bar Chart - Vehicle Year:**

* Represents the distribution of vehicle years for both BEVs and PHEVs.

**6. Dynamic Selection:**

* Users can select a specific car make on the right side of the dashboard.
* The dashboard dynamically updates to highlight the selected make in the column chart and adjusts the donut chart, top counties, map, and stacked bar chart accordingly.

## Technologies Used

* Tableau
* Data sourced from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)

## Results and Impact

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the electric vehicle landscape in Washington, offering users valuable insights into the distribution, makes, and key characteristics of EVs. This visualization tool aids in making informed decisions and understanding the trends in the EV market.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include incorporating real-time data updates, additional filters for a more granular analysis, and exploring the possibility of expanding the dashboard to cover a broader geographical area.
